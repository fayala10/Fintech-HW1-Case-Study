* Betterment

* When was the company incorporated?
* Who are the founders of the company?
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Betterment started the same way many great companies are born, during times of crisis and resiliency. During the 2008 Financial crisis,
Jon Stein and Eli Broverman began to build an online platform idea, for an automated investing platform. During the first 2 years after being incorporated,
the founders developed a platform using MySQL as database in order to be launch, and in 2009 became a FINRA member. Early on, the company was seen
as an innovative company and disruptor in the financial industry. Betterment officially launched during TechCrunch Disrupt of New York in 2010,
winning the award of “Biggest New York Disruptor”. After the successful launch, the company attracted its first customers and early investors. 
During 2010 and 2012, Betterment received various funding rounds from Venture Capital groups, and by 2012 the company established a line of products ranging
from IRAs, automatic deposits, and goal-based investing advice. Betterment has become a smart money manage, offering everyday banking services, 
along their core investing and retirement solutions. The company received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010 and in 
October 2012 Menlo Ventures provided Series B Funding along other VC. In 2014, betterment received $32 million round of series C funding from new Investors
Northwestern Mutual Capital, Globespan Capital Partners and Citigroup Inc’s Citi Ventures capital unit. As of their last funding in Aug 2017, Betterment 
has raised a total of $275 Mill over 7 rounds.  

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Betterment’s mission is to simplify and lower the cost of financial services, by offering a money manager platform and using cutting edge technology tools to 
create a one stop shop for clients financial goals. For many years, the concept of financial advise seemed to be a cumbersome and expensive process that 
many consumers didn't know how to approach. The principal users of technology in finance are Millenials. This demographic is embracing change and disruption, and 
are the responsibles for the creation and innovation in this sector. Millenials naturally have a distrust in the traditional banking and investment institutions. 
They have witnessed pivotal financial moments, including the 2001 dot.com bubble, 2008 financial crisis and several ponzi schemes. It is clear consumers are demanding 
a better digital experience, with transparency and customer centric models. Additionally, the fees for investment advice with a financial adviosr vary greatly across 
firms and in some cases, financial advisors can charge 2-3% annual management fees. On top of this annual fee, advisors can buy active mutual funds which charge 
additional high fees. Many times these financial firms downplay the impact of fees in your investments by burying them in the fine print. These fees can potentially 
turn into hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime. As a result of these practices, consumers are demanding greater transparency, not only with fees structure 
but with knowing that their advisor has their best interest in mind. Additionally, Betterment has made the process of saving and investing easier by creating a user 
friendly platform, enabling customers to invest extra cash sitting in their deposit accounts, and allocating these funds into a robo avdisor investment platform.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Betterment has become on of the leaders in the robo advising Fintech Industry. The company has constantly update and rebreanded their online website and digital platforms.
The company uses alogirthms to create asset allocation based on each clients financial goal. This is accomplished by gathering very detail client information to determine
the clients risk tolerance and investment horizon. Some of the main benefits of using a robo-advisors, is that it takes emotions out of the equation. As humans, we tend to 
over react with negative and positive news. One of the main reasons beginer investors in the stock market fail, is trading in fear or acting based on emotions. In the other
hand, alogirthms have a set equation based on the clients financial objective, and if the criteria is not met, trere is no trade. Betterment also has a feature called 
two-way cash sweep. This function will shift money between betterment's high yield cash account and the cheking account. This is all determine automatically be the
platform if the client has excess funds in the checking account that could earn higher interest. Conversely, if the balance in your checking account is too low, it will
sweep back to the account. Betterment's digital platform also allows client to simulate different scenarios or life changing events, to see how it can affect the 
clients overall financial goals.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Extend its services to Internationl Clients. Allowing them to establish a banking and investment relationship, and develop a cross-border money transfer service. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Betterment has been able to develop a user friendly digital platform where clients can consolidate most of their banking and investment needs. Most international clients that 
want to establish a bank relationship in the US, are not able to do it remotely. The process is lengthy, not client friendly, and in most cases clients must be 
present in a physical location, in order to establish the account. Betterment could extend its service to markets outside the US, and increment its market share. In many cases, the 
process for NRA clients to open a banking or investment relationship, can take weeks and can become a painful process with countless requirements. In addition to streamline the
account opening process, the company can develop services for this client segment, such as international transfers. The company could capitalize this market segment, as 
international clients will be highly motivated to establish a relationship with a bank that could offer banking, investments and international transfers on a single platform.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Some of the tecnologies that can be adopted and implemented by having international clients is mobile cross-border money transfers. There are already companies taking advantage of 
this service. Some of the companies are OFX, TransferWise, and Paypal among others. in addition to offer banking and investments services to potential international clients, 
Betterment could set up a mobile to mobile transfer system, enabling users to directly send money from their phone to friends and family. Given the recent events of 
the pandemic covid 19, consumers demands continue changing and the need for convenient and readily accesible solutions are expected. Current wires transfer and 
internatioanl money transfer can be expensive. Additionally, banks that operate in one country, have miminum amounts or no exposure to foreign currencies. Hence, when 
clients need to transfer funds to other countries, the bank goes to a FX market on behalf of client. Not only this cost is passed to the client, but banks will add a
signfifican margin to this exchange rate. One model that can be replicate it in Betterments platform, is transferWise international transfer model. This model consists of 
cross matching customers who are willing exchange the same currencies but in opposite directions. Through this model, the fees are minimal as there is no need
to go to the FX market and buy different currencies.
